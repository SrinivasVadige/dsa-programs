     * Like, what if we rob 3rd house (n+p) and what if we rob 2nd house (c). And we keep the max robbed money in 3rd house
     * p is the previous max money we can rob if we choose 3rd house instead of 2nd house
     * If "is rob 3rd house" failed? i.e n+p < c 2nd house then we can change our decision to rob 2nd house and it predecessors
     * i.e temp = max money we can rob until this point - with our decision making tree
     *
     * Finally we store max money in c "nums.length - 1" house but can not say that p is second max
     * In for loop we go to next house then the previous 'c' house will become 'p' 3rd house for the new next house and 'c' as 2nd house
     * that is the reason why we assign c value to p and temp value to c
