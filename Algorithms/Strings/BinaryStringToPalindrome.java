<pre>
You are given a binary string, s, consisting of characters 'O' and '1'. Transform this string into a palindrome by performing some operations. In one operation, swap any two characters, [l) and s[j]. Determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the string a palindrome. If it is impossible to do so, then return -1.
Note: A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example, strings
"O", "111", "010", "10101" are palindromes, but strings "001", "10", "11101" are not.
Example
Let string s = "0100101"
'. The following shows
the minimum number of steps required. It uses
1-based indexing.
â€¢ Swap characters with indices (4, 5)
