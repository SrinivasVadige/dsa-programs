 * <pre>
 * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree that satisfies the Binary Search Tree property / BST invariant
 * which means that for every node, the value of the left subtree nodes are less than the value of the node
 * and the value of the right subtree nodes are greater than the value of the node
 *
 * Examples:
 *                      5
 *                 _____|_____
 *                /           \
 *               3             7
 *              / \           / \
 *             2   4         6   8
 *
 *
 *                       1
 *                        \
 *                         20
 *                         /
 *                        19
 *                       /
 *                      2
 *                       \
 *                        3
 *                         \
 *                          18
 *                         /
 *                        17
 *
 * BSTs are used in many applications, for example in searching, sorting, and storing data.
 * - Implementation of some map and set ADTs
 * - Red Black Trees
 * - AVL Trees
 * - Splay Trees
 * - Binary Heaps
 * - Syntax trees (used by compilers and calculators)
 * - Treap tree - A probabilistic DS called Randomized BST
 * - In Priority Queues but not Heaps
