We can create multiple asynchronous threads in Java using:
1. Thread class
2. Runnable interface
3. ExecutorService class
4. CompletableFuture
5. ThreadPoolExecutor
6. ScheduledExecutorService
7. Fork/Join framework -- Java 21

NOTE:
1. In Runnable Functional Interface and Thread constructor, we override run() method but we can execute it using start() or run().
2. Don't Use .run() instead of .start() ----> because t1.run(); // ‚ùå runs synchronously in the current thread, That‚Äôs not parallel
    it just runs like a normal method call.
    new Thread(r1);	Creates a thread (but does nothing)
    thread.start();	Starts the thread (runs r1.run() in a new thread)
    r1.run();	Just runs run() in the current thread (no multithreading)
3. run() == start() + join()
4. run() or start()+join() in Java is the same as Async Await in JavaScript
5. We cannot start a thread twice in Java. Once a thread has completed execution, it cannot be restarted.
    If you attempt to call start() on a thread that has already been started, Java throws an IllegalThreadStateException.
    This restriction exists because allowing a thread to restart would complicate the thread lifecycle and potentially lead to inconsistent state.
    If you need to execute the same task multiple times, you should create a new thread instance or use "executor services" üî• which are designed for repeated task execution.
6. thread.stop(); // ‚ùå DEPRECATED and dangerous
    It was unsafe because it could leave shared resources (locks, files, memory) in an inconsistent state.
    It could kill a thread midway through critical code, breaking invariants.
7. We can create a thread inside another thread
8. The custom wait, notify and notifyAll is defined in Object Class and not on Thread class in Java
    because the wait-notify mechanism operates on object monitors (intrinsic locks), not on threads themselves.
    Every object in Java has an associated monitor that can be used for synchronization.
    A thread doesn't wait on another thread; it waits on an object's monitor until notified by another thread.
    Since any object can serve as a synchronization point, these methods belong in Object class
9. Different ways to achieve synchronization in Java:
    1) Synchronized Method: "public synchronized void criticalMethod() {}"
    2) Synchronized Block: "public void method() { synchronized (lockObject) {} }"
    3) Explicit locks (ReentrantLock): private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); public void criticalMethod() { lock.lock(); ... lock.unlock(); }
    4) Atomic variables: private AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0); public void increment() {counter.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation }
    5) Thread-safe collections: Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>()); private Map<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); public void update(String key, String value) {map.put(key, value); // Thread-safe operation}
10. Fork/Join framework different from traditional thread pools
    1) Work-stealing algorithm
    2) Divide-and-conquer paradigm
    3) ForkJoinPool class
    4) Recursive task decomposition
    5) Dynamic load balancing
11. CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier in Java --> both are synchronization aids, used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads
    CountDownLatch acts as a one-time gate that remains closed until a count reaches zero. Threads can decrement the counter, and any thread can wait for the count to reach zero.
    CyclicBarrier makes a set of threads wait for each other to reach a common barrier point, and can be reused after all threads are released.
12. Handle thread interruption in Java
    1) Checking for interruption status: if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { ... }
    2) Handling InterruptedException from blocking methods: try { Thread.sleep(1000); ... } catch (InterruptedException e) { ... Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
    3) Propagating interruption in methods that can't handle it: public void myMethod() throws InterruptedException { while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { Thread.sleep(100); ... } }
13. Check if a Thread holds a lock or not
    Object lockObject = new Object();
    synchronized (lockObject) {
    // Inside synchronized block
    boolean hasLock = Thread.holdsLock(lockObject); // Returns true
    System.out.println("Current thread holds lock: " + hasLock);
    }
    // Outside synchronized block
    boolean hasLock = Thread.holdsLock(lockObject); // Returns false
14. To get a thread dump in Java
    1) Using jstack tool: jstack <pid>
    2) From the command line for the running JVM: On Windows: Press Ctrl + Break in the console On Unix/Linux: Send SIGQUIT signal with kill -3 <pid>
    3) Using Java Management Extensions (JMX):
    ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    threadMXBean.dumpAllThreads(true, true);
15. Fair locking: To implement fair locking where threads acquire the lock in first-come, first-served order, use ReentrantLock with fairness enabled:
    ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true);
    fairLock.lock();
16. volatile keyword: To make a variable visible to all threads and all threads can change that volatile variable value, use the volatile keyword:
    int count = 0;
    volatile int count = 0;
17. visibility and atomicity in multithreading:
    Visibility concerns whether changes made by one thread are visible to other threads
    Atomicity ensures that operations are indivisible
18. concurrency and parallelism: Concurrency is about structure and design and  parallelism is about execution
19. Virtual Threads are introduced in Java 19 and stable in Java 21, Lightweight threads managed by the JVM, not the OS.
    You can create millions of them without exhausting system threads.
    Backed by the ForkJoinPool (but you don‚Äôt feel it).
    Designed for scalable, blocking code (e.g. networking, DB).
    Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> sout("Hello from virtual thread"))
    try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    scope.fork(() -> someBlockingCall());
    scope.join();
    scope.throwIfFailed();
    }

EXECUTOR SERVICE CLASS:
    We can create ExecutorService class objects using Executors class like this:
    1) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
    2) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    3) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    4) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3);
    5) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newWorkStealingPool();
    6) ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor(); // Introduced in Java 19 and stabled in Java 21
    7) ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
    8) ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();




DIFFERENT .SUBMIT() METHODS IN EXECUTOR SERVICE CLASS:
    In ExecutorService.submit() method, we can pass Runnable or Callable
    <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);
    Future<?> submit(Runnable task
    <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);
    public void execute(Runnable command){}

    .submit(Runnable task) ‚Äî Fire and Track

     6. awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) -- to wait for the thread to terminate
     7. invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<?>> tasks) -- to invoke all the threads -----> will wait for all the threads to complete just like awaitTermination() and futureResult.get()
     8. invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<?>> tasks) -- to invoke any of the threads
     9. invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<?>> tasks, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) -- to invoke any of the threads
     10. execute(Runnable command) -- to execute the thread
     11. schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit) -- to schedule the thread
     12. scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit) -- to schedule the thread
     13. scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit) -- to schedule the thread

     18. In ExecutorService.shutdown() method, we can shutdown the thread
     19. In ExecutorService.shutdownNow() method, we can shutdown the thread
     20. Future<?> futureResult = executorService.submit();
         futureResult.get(); ----> will wait for the thread to complete, just like join() in Thread class üî•




 COMPLETABLE FUTURE CLASS:
    Java 8 introduced CompletableFuture class, which is used to handle asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way.
