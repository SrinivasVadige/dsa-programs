/* 
    The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. 
    It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers remains the same 
    even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.

    To find the GCD of n1 and n2 where n1 > n2:

    Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of them becomes 0.
    Once one of them becomes 0, the other number is the GCD of the original numbers.
    Eg, n1 = 20, n2 = 15:

    gcd(20, 15) = gcd(20-15, 15) = gcd(5, 15)

    gcd(5, 15) = gcd(15-5, 5) = gcd(10, 5)

    gcd(10, 5) = gcd(10-5, 5) = gcd(5, 5)

    gcd(5, 5) = gcd(5-5, 5) = gcd(0, 5)

    Hence, return 5 as the gcd.

    or 
    largestNum = smallNum*multiplier + remainder   // multiplier is quotient
    => prevSmallNumOrNewLarge = prevRemainderOrNewSmall*newMultiplier + newRemainder  
    => prevRemainder will become the new smallNum another approach

    that means lNum % sNum = someQuorient, 
    so this Remainder be be our new sNum and previous sNum be will be new lNum
    now loop until, we get Remainder as 0

    but here in our code, we just assign the Remainder to largeNum so, this will become new small num
    then the other number will automatically become the new largeNum without doing anything
